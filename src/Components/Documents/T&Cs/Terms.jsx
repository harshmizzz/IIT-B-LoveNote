                You should be aware that there are certain things that Aify
                innovation labs Pvt Ltd will not take responsibility for.
                Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an
                active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or
                provided by your mobile network provider, but Aify innovation
                labs Pvt Ltd cannot take responsibility for the app not working
                at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you
                don’t have any of your data allowance left.
              </div>
              <div className="guidelinescontentdetails">
                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile
                network provider will still apply. As a result,you may be
                charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the
                duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other
                third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
                datacharges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                (i.e. region or country)without turning off data roaming. If you
                are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the
                app, please be aware that we assume that you have received
                permission from the bill payer for using the app.

                Along the same lines, Aify innovation labs Pvt Ltd cannot always
                take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Aify
                innovation labs Pvt Ltd cannot accept responsibility.
