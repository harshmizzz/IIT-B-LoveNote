                By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
                apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
                carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
                modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any
                way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of
                the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
                other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself,
                and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
                intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Aify
                innovation labs Pvt Ltd . Aify innovation labs Pvt Ltd is
                committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
                possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes

                any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services

                The Lovenote app stores and processes personal data that you
                have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your
                responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure.
                We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your
                phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
                and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
                device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
                malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                security features and it could mean that the Lovenote app won’t
                work properly or at all.

                You should be aware that there are certain things that Aify
                innovation labs Pvt Ltd will not take responsibility for.
                Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an
                active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
                provided by your mobile network provider, but Aify innovation
                labs Pvt Ltd cannot take responsibility for the app not working
                at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you
                don’t have any of your data allowance left.
              </div>
              <div className="guidelinescontentdetails">
                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the
                duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other
                third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
                region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
                not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
                please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
                from the bill payer for using the app.
              </div>
              <div className="guidelinescontentdetails">
                Along the same lines, Aify innovation labs Pvt Ltd cannot always
                take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Aify
                innovation labs Pvt Ltd cannot accept responsibility. With
                respect to Aify innovation labs Pvt Ltd ’s responsibility for
                your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important
                to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to
                provide information to us so that we can make it available to
                you. Aify innovation labs Pvt Ltd accepts no liability for any
                loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                wholly on this functionality of the app.
              </div>
              <div className="guidelinescontentdetails">
                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both
                systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
                availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
                download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Aify
                innovation labs Pvt Ltd does not promise that it will always
                update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with
                the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your
                device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
                application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
                providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
                without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
                otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses
                granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using
                the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
